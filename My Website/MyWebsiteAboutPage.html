<p id = "Title"> About Me </p>
<p id = "Para1"> My name is Robert Henry Cowherd (I almost always go by Henry). I grew up on a farm in Upstate New York, just south of Albany. I currently live in Manhattan in the Financial District,
where I commute to school in Brooklyn. I go to NYU's Tandon School of Engineering, where I am in my third year of study as a Computer Engineering Major with a Minor in Math. Sustainability and automation
    in the food, energy and transportation sectors and mobile applications that provide ease-of-access. Within the field of Computer Science, I have a particular interest in mobile applications.
    I am most interested in those that provide ease-of-access for financial tools (Robinhood, Mint, Acorns), as well as platforms for the Gig Economy (Uber, Doordash, Fiverr).
    I am eager to help develop automated transportation and food delivery services, especially those that are sustainably powered.
</p>

<p id="Para3"> The first major project that I am trying to bring to fruition is a system of remotely controlled robotic delivery and labor services designed to bring equity to less developed countries via the remote employment of delivery and labor robot
    operators. Fueled by the disparity in buying power across different nations, this project aims to create equity by paying people in underdeveloped countries well above the average wages they are used to, while
    simultaneously creating more competition and reducing labor and delivery costs in more developed countries. Not only does this system create equity, but it paves the way for full automation of delivery and labor services.
