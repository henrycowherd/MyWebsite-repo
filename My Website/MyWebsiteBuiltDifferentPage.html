<p id = "Para1">
    Posing a solution to power-consumption problems facing modern search and rescue missions, the Built Different IALAD (In-Air Landing and Deployment) System
    is a new approach to drones as we know them. A smaller recon drone lands and a carrier drone, allowing the larger drone to land or hover while the smaller
    drone covers a larger area and takes camera footage. This enables the same area to be surveyed using significantly less battery power. Using a remotely activated latch,
    a ring attached to the recon drone is fastened to a cone assembly the frame of the larger drone.

    The Built Different drone won the Best Design and People's Choice awards at the 2022 NYU Tandon School of Engineering Senior Design Project Capstone Competition. The drone received acknowledgment from both NYU President
    Andrew Hamilton and NYU Tandon's Dean Jelena Kovacevic.
